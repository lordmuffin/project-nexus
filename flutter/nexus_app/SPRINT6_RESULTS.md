## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Patterns
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation between ML services and UI components
- **Provider Pattern**: Riverpod for dependency injection and state management
- **Stream-Based**: Real-time updates using Dart streams for transcription results
- **Platform Channels**: Native Android integration for optimal speech recognition performance
- **Fallback Strategy**: Cross-platform speech recognition as backup

### Speech Recognition Configuration
```kotlin
// Android Native Configuration
RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_LANGUAGE_MODEL: LANGUAGE_MODEL_FREE_FORM
RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_PARTIAL_RESULTS: true
RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_PREFER_OFFLINE: false
RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_DICTATION_MODE: true
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Permission Errors**: Graceful fallback to audio-only recording
- **Network Errors**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Speech Timeout**: Auto-restart for continuous recognition
- **Service Unavailable**: Fallback to cross-platform implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Initialization**: Services initialized only when needed
- **Stream Debouncing**: Efficient UI updates without excessive rebuilds
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of native resources
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking speech recognition operations
