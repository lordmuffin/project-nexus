## Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:

- **Camera**: For QR code scanning
- **Microphone**: For audio recording

These permissions are requested when needed and can be managed in your device settings.

## Privacy

- âœ… All audio processing happens locally on your Nexus server
- âœ… No data is sent to external servers
- âœ… Communication is limited to your local network only
- âœ… QR codes contain time-limited tokens for secure pairing

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **Make sure both devices are on the same WiFi network**
2. **Check that the Nexus server is running** (`pnpm backend` from root directory)
3. **Try manual connection** with the server IP address
4. **Regenerate QR code** if pairing fails (tokens expire after 5 minutes)

### Recording Issues

1. **Check microphone permissions** in device settings
2. **Ensure good network connection** for audio upload
3. **Verify server connection** in the app settings
