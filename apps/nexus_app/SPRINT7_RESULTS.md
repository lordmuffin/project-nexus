## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Enhanced with search and filtering capabilities
- **Service Layer**: Export service with platform-specific implementations
- **Component Library**: Reusable tag and search components
- **State Management**: Riverpod providers for search and filter state
- **Stream-Based Updates**: Real-time UI updates with database streams

### Search & Filter Implementation
```dart
// Advanced search with filters
Stream<List<Meeting>> watchMeetingsWithFilters({
  String? searchQuery,
  MeetingSearchFilters? filters,
});

// Filter model with comprehensive options
class MeetingSearchFilters {
  final DateTime? startDate;
  final DateTime? endDate;
  final int? minDuration;
  final int? maxDuration;
  final bool? hasTranscript;
  final bool? hasSummary;
  final bool? hasActionItems;
  final List<String> tags;
  final MeetingSortBy sortBy;
  final bool sortDescending;
}
```

### Tag System Architecture
```dart
// Tag management with JSON storage
Future<void> updateTags(int meetingId, List<String> tags);
List<String> parseTags(String? tagsJson);
Future<List<String>> getAllTags();

// UI components for tag interaction
TagChip(tag: string, onDeleted: callback, onTap: callback, isSelected: bool)
TagSelector(initialTags: list, availableTags: list, onTagsChanged: callback)
SelectableTagList(allTags: list, selectedTags: list, onSelectionChanged: callback)
```

### Export Service Design
```dart
// Multi-format export with flexible options
Future<void> exportMeeting(Meeting meeting, {
  required ExportFormat format,
  bool includeTranscript = true,
  bool includeSummary = true,
  bool includeActionItems = true,
  bool includeMetadata = true,
});

// Format-specific content generation
enum ExportFormat { text, markdown, json, csv }
```
